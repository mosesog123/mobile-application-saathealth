# mobile-application-saathealth
below are the sample file for a mobile application 
the data had alot of missing values 
reg date had 50 percent of missing values 
i filled it using two columns comparing them and equally predicting the date 
uninstall nan value means the given person hasnt uninstalled the application 
the data is imbalanced 
# According to my understanding the more time a user spends on the app the less chances of him uninstalling .
# session count is low for a number of user 
# share count is low 
# notification received is by many and user have dismissd many notification 
# quiz count as well as video count is as well low not many people have actually used the application
